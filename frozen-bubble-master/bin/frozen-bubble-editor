=head1 NAME

frozen-bubble-editor - a level editor for Frozen Bubble

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    frozen-bubble-editor [OPTION]...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This editor lets you manipulate level-sets, in which you can add, remove
and modify levels thanks to a mouse-oriented interface (there are also
many interesting keyboard shortcuts). The interface is very
straightforward: click on the written planches on the left an right parts
of the screen to perform the relevant actions, and on the level area to
change the bubble color; use the "void" bubble (or right-click) to
remove a bubble.
