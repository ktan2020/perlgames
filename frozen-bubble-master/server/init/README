This directory contains a suggested initscript and skeleton
configuration file for automatic starting of the Frozen-Bubble
server.

Since the Frozen-Bubble server at least needs to know the preferred
language for players (it is just an indication used by players
when choosing a server, so that they can chat using their native
language), a configuration file is best suited for this purpose.

The initscript by default launches one server for each
'/etc/fb-server*.conf' files (-c commandline option controls the
name of the configuration file, if you need to modify its
location or name). You have to install and modify the skeleton
configuration file specifying the name of your server to setup a
unique server, and copy the file to a different name (and change
option values) for all subsequent servers you can host. For first
server you must at least set the language, and for all subsequent
servers you must also specify a different port. Note: if you host
multiple servers, it is probably a good idea to not use the same
server name for each of them (even if languages are different) so
that players can easily rendez-vous on the correct server.

If needed, other configuration parameters can be set in the
configuration file. Each configuration parameter must be on its
own line, first character is the name of the option, followed if
needed by a space character and the string parameter of the
option. The list of options can be retrieved by launching the
Frozen-Bubble server with option '--help'.

Here's an example of configuration file copied from the skeleton
configuration file, but also specifying the server name and
language, a different server port and LAN mode:

--------8<--------8<--------8<--------8<--------8<--------8<-----
# Name of the server as seen by FB players
n zarb
# Preferred language of players
a en
# Change default port
p 1789
# Also create an UDP server for easy LAN games.
l
--------8<--------8<--------8<--------8<--------8<--------8<-----

Notice that the registration process of the server is done
automatically if the -q option is not set. The remote end as seen
by www.frozen-bubble.org is used as IP, and the TCP port used
(defaults to 1511 or specified with -p) as port. If you're using
host/port forwarding, you can use the options -H and -P to
register the proper host/port as seen from outside.
