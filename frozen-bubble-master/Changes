=head2 2.0.0  2006-10-27

=over

=item

new 1-player game mode: multiplayer training; uses
identical game rules as multiplayer, generated malus
bubbles are counted as points - what score will you
be able to reach in the 2 minutes time frame?

=item

network (Internet) game: up to 5 players in a game (net
game system has logic able to transparently handle
players behind a NAT)

=item

LAN game: similar to network game except that no
connection to Internet is made, substituted by polling
the local network

=item

fully revamped graphics, including now 3d-based smooth
penguin eyecandy

=item

revamped intro and 1p music into fully digital productions

=item

full joystick support: just move your joystick(s) or
push buttons in the "change keys" dialog (analog
joysticks handled as digital for fair play)

when trying to used your joystick in Frozen-Bubble, if
nothing comes up, most probably your joystick isn't
configured correctly (or supported in Linux), use -ji
commandline switch to verify your joystick is detected
properly; if it is not, try to load the proper kernel modules
etc - for example, "joydev" is needed, but it is sometimes
not automatically loaded when plugging in a joystick (even in
modern distros and with USB joysticks)

=item

recording and playback of all games with non-predefined
levels (1-player in random and multiplayer training,
local 2-player, and network/LAN game with 2 to 5
players) - trigger a record by hitting the Print Screen
key during a game, or record all games by starting with
--auto-record

=item

realtime graphical effects in the menu screen (if your
computer is fast enough)

=item

anti-aliased+shaded+localized messages

=back
